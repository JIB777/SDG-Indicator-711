# SDG-Indicator-711

About:

This repository contains the scripts that CIESIN used to compute SDG Indicator 7.1.1 with global open data. According to the United Nations (UN) it is estimated that [in 2019, 759 million people around the world lacked access to electricity](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-07/). Due to current policies and the impact of COVID-19, it is predicted that [by 2030, 660 million people will still not have access to electricity, with a majority residing in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2021/goal-07/). SDG 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” As one measure of progress, the UN agreed on [SDG Indicator 7.1.1](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=&Target=7.1): “Proportion of population with access to electricity”.

Access to electricity was computed for 206 countries and 46,069 administrative level 2 subnational units using [Visible and Infrared Imaging Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnl/) and [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) gridded population data with a combination of zonal statistics and table calculations. This work was completed in support of the [Group on Earth Observations (GEO)](https://earthobservations.org/index.php) [Human Planet Initiative (HPI)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/HPI.php). CIESIN plans to update the SDG Indicator 7.1.1: Access to Electricity data set annually to help countries track their progress towards SDG 7 and to facilitate international comparisons.
