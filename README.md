# SDG-Indicator-711

About:
This repository contains the scripts CIESIN used to compute SDG Indicator 7.1.1 with global open data. Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report estimated that in 2019, 759 million people around the world lacked access to electricity. Due to current policies and the impact of COVID-19, it is predicted that by 2030, 660 million people will still not have access to electricity, with a majority residing in Sub-Saharan Africa. SDG 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” As one measure of progress, the UN agreed on SDG Indicator 7.1.1: “Proportion of population with access to electricity”.

Access to electricity was computed for 206 countries and 46,069 administrative level 2 subnational units using Visible and Infrared Imaging Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights and WorldPop gridded population data with a combination of zonal statistics and table calculations. This work was completed in support of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Human Planet Initiative (HPI). CIESIN plans to update the SDG Indicator 7.1.1: Access to Electricity data set annually to help countries track their progress towards SDG 7 and to facilitate international comparisons.
